        </section>

        <p class="text-about">Welcome to the world of Homero, a man who proves it's never too late to follow your
            passion. Homero is a
            composer with a story as rich and heartfelt as his music. Though he's now in his 70s, his musical journey
            began in earnest just a few years ago. He spent most of his life dedicated to his family and work, with
            music always humming in the background. But as he entered retirement, he decided it was time to step into
            the spotlight and create his own melodies.<br><br>

            Homero's main instrument is the piano and keyboard, which he plays with a gentle touch and a profound sense
            of feeling. He also enjoys picking up the guitar and saxophone from time to time, adding different textures
            to his compositions. His music is deeply personal, serving as a tribute to the people he loves. Many of his
            songs are beautiful love letters to his beloved wife, a testament to their enduring bond. He also writes
            about the warmth of family and the joy of simple moments, pouring his heart into every note.<br><br>

            Despite not being a professional musician, Homero's dedication and talent shine through. He composes for the
            sheer joy of it, sharing his creations with the world. He's also fortunate to have some friends
            who are musicians, and they lend their voices to his pieces, bringing his heartfelt lyrics to life.<br><br>

            You can listen to Homero's compositions on Spotify and YouTube. We invite you to explore his music and get
            to know the man behind the melodies. His journey is a beautiful reminder that passion has no age limit, and
            that some of the most beautiful stories are written later in life.</p>
